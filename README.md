The Pig Game is a classic two-player dice game that combines luck and strategy. The objective is to be the first player to reach a score of 100. Players take turns rolling a six-sided dice and accumulating points based on the rolls. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose their current turn's points, and the turn passes to the other player.
